  <p> Welcome to my personal page! My name is Jihyun kang and until my Sophomore spring semester I have attended Queens College CUNY and majored in Finance. I pursued in Finance as a freshman becoming fascinated by being around the very motivated and well around social colleagues of mine whom also had the drive to better themselves and the peers around them. As this upcoming fall semester of my junior year was approaching, I've seen my sister who attended The Knowledge House slowly become this self-driven, confident person all around as she submerged into this organization. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn from this 10 week JavaScript course as I continue my education at Nassau community college pursing my major as a Civil engineer before transferring to San Diego State University for my bachelor's. With this opportunity to grow with TKH, I can learn the skills to better my future, and hopefully be able to give back and help the community in any way possible through The Knowledge House..</p>
